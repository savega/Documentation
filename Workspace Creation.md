# Workspace Creation 

To create a new TIMU Workspace, go to the Teams app, locate the Team you want the new Workspace to belong to, and click the triple-dot icon next to the Team’s name. From the context menu, select “New Workspace”.

Select whether you would like your new Workspace to be private or Team-wide. Private Workspaces are visible only to their members, and users in your Team must be invited to join a private Workspace. Team-wide Workspaces automatically include everyone in your Team. If you don’t know what to choose, we recommend creating a Team-wide Workspace.

You will then be prompted for a Workspace name. Your Workspace name must be unique within your Team. When you’ve finished, click “Create” to finalize your Workspace. You will be taken automatically to the Posts module of the newly created Workspace. If you chose to create a private Workspace, the Manage Workspace Permissions dialog will appear.
