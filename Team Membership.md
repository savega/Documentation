From the Manage Team Members dialog, you can choose whether each member of the Team is an owner or a member, as well as to revoke their membership in the Team (removing them from the Team and any Workspaces within the Team).

To add new members to the team, click the “Add Team Member” button. SEE: [Invite to TIMU](Invite%20to%20TIMU.html)
