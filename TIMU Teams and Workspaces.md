# TIMU Teams and Workspaces

## Creating a Team

TIMU Teams are how people within your network are organized into groups. In your organization, you might have Teams for different departments, different initiatives, different committees, or different projects. Teams help people communicate with one another and stay in the loop. For example, you might create a Team for planning company events, or a Team dedicated to recruiting.

To get started creating a Team, open the TIMU app. You’ll see a menu option labeled “Start a Team”. Click that option to open the Create a New Team dialog.

The first step is to select a privacy level for your Team. There are three levels of Team privacy in TIMU:

-   Org-wide: Only network administrators can create org-wide Teams. Everyone in the network is automatically made a member of all org-wide Teams. Use this privacy level for Teams you want to ensure everyone in your organization belongs to by default - you might have an Employee Resources Team where you can schedule company events and host important company policy documents, for example.


-   Optional: Anyone can create an optional Team. Optional Teams are available for anyone to join, but users are not members of optional Teams by default. To see a list of optional Teams and to join one, click the option labeled “Join a Team” in the TIMU Workspaces app.


-   Standard: Anyone can create a standard Team. Standard Teams are invitation-only, and do not appear on the list of teams for users to join on their own. If you want to join a standard Team, you will need to get in touch with one of the owners of that Team.

Next, you’ll be prompted to provide a name for your Team, and an optional description. The Team name must be unique within your network, and cannot contain any spaces. If you enter a name that is already in use by another Team, you’ll be asked to provide a different name.

To finish creating your Team, click the “Create” button. Once your Team has been created, you will see it in your list of teams in the TIMU Workspaces app.

## Creating a Workspace

Each TIMU Team contains one or more Workspaces. A Workspace provides its members with a posts feed, a file library, a task module, and an events calendar. When a new Team is created, a Workspace named “General” will be automatically created within that Team.

To create a new Workspace within a Team, click “New Workspace” under that Team’s heading in the Workspaces app.

You will be prompted to select a level of privacy for your Workspaces. There are three levels of Workspace privacy in TIMU:

-   Standard: All members of the Team automatically have access to the Workspace.


-   Optional: Any member of the Team can see this Workspace and join it, but Team members are not members of the Workspace by default.


-   Private: An owner of the Workspace will need to add Team members to the Workspace. Team members will not see this Workspace unless they are also members of that Workspace.

Next, you’ll be prompted to provide a name for your Workspace, and an optional description. The Workspace name must be unique within its Team, and cannot contain any spaces.

To finish creating your Workspace, click the “Create” button. Once your Workspace has been created, you’ll be automatically taken to its posts feed.
