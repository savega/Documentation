# File Details

The File Details dialog allows you to preview many kinds of files without downloading them, and provides tools for managing files of any type.

The largest area in the File Details dialog contains the file preview. Most common image file types can be previewed, as can Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel, and Powerpoint). If a file cannot be previewed in TIMU, a notice will appear in the preview area.

The sizing selector at the bottom of the preview area switches between Size to Fit and Full Size. When Size to Fit is selected, the image is shrunk (if necessary) to fit within the preview area. When Full Size is selected, the image will appear at its actual dimensions, even if that means it isn't fully visible within the preview area.

On the right side of the File Details dialog are tabs for managing the file. The first tab (and the default tab when the dialog is opened) is the Information tab. From here, you can download the file directly to your device, share the file with others, or delete the file from TIMU.

The second tab is the history tab. Each time a new version of this file is uploaded to TIMU, a new entry will be added in the history tab. You can select one of these entries to download previous versions of this file.

The final tab is the comments tab. Comments on a file work just like comments anywhere else in TIMU (e.g., comments on tasks or events). You can mention users in your comment to send notifications.
