# Create Task

TIMU tasks can be created in two different ways. The first is to create a new task directly on the task grid, using the row at the bottom of the grid labeled "New Task". Clicking this row will add a new row to the grid, and filling in that row will create a new task.

The second way of creating a new task is to click the "+ New Task" button above the task grid.

The New Task dialog will appear. The form in the dialog lists a few built-in fields that are standard in all tasks, as well as any custom fields configured in this Team Workspace that are flagged as required fields. The user specified in the "Assigned To" field will receive a notification when the task is created.

To finish creating the task, fill in the form and click the "Create" button. The task will immediately be added to the bottom of the task grid (unless it would be filtered out by the currently selected facets).
