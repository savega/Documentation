# Create Folder

Folders are an easy way to organize your files within your workspace. For the most part, they work just like folders on your computer. You can upload or move files to them, and share folders as links. You can even create folders within existing folders, in case you need to categorize your files even further.

To create a new folder, go to your workspace’s file library. On the top toolbar, click “Create Folder”. You will be prompted to provide a name for the new folder. Folders must have a name, and can’t share the same name as another folder or file in the same location. Once you’ve given your folder a name, click the “Create” button, and you’re done!

To open your new folder, just click on its name in your file library.
