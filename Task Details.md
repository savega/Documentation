# Task Details

The Task Details dialog is where you can find all of the information about a specific TIMU task, including all of its fields, history, and any team discussion around the task.

The Task Details dialog is separated into two areas: the Comments/Details area, and the Attachments/History area. Tab controls at the top of each of these areas let you change the current tab.

The Details tab contains all of the field information for this task. From here, you can both view and edit the task's fields. Edits are applied immediately.

The Comments tab contains all discussion around this task by team members, and works like any other comment or chat area in TIMU. Note that if someone is assigned to this task, they will automatically receive a notification when someone comments on the task, even if they weren't directly mentioned in the comment.

The Attachments tab displays a list of all file attachments posted to this task, whether from the task's comments or from any file attachment fields associated with the task.

The History tab displays a chronological report of all field changes made to this task since its creation, and who made those changes.
