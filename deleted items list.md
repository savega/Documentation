# Deleted Items List

When you initially delete a record in TIMU - whether it's a task, a comment, or a file - that record is archived and hidden from most views, but is not permanently deleted. To view archived items, open the Team Workspace context menu and select "Show Deleted Items...".

Those items will be removed from the deleted items list and restored to their original location in your Team Workspace.

To permanently delete items, select one or more items from the list and click "Permanently Delete". Those items will be removed from the deleted items list and permanently deleted.
