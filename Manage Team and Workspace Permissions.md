# Manage Team and Workspace Permissions

The people working on your projects change over time, and your TIMU Teams and Workspaces change with them! To add members, or to change the level of permissions of individual users within your Team or Workspace, open the Team or Workspace context menu and select the "Manage Permissions" option.

From the Team Permissions or Workspace Permissions dialog, you can select whether individual members are considered Owners or Contributors. Owners have the ability to manage all aspects of the Team or Workspace. Contributors have access to the Team or Workspace but cannot make changes to the configuration or settings of the Team or Workspace.

To add new members to the Team or Workspace, type the name or email address of the new member in the search bar. When they appear in the list of suggested people, select their name to add them.

Bear in mind that if you are attempting to add a new member to a Workspace, that person needs to belong to the Workspace's Team. If that person isn't already on the Team, you will need to add them to the Team first.

If you are attempting to add a new person to a Team, that person needs to belong to the Network. You can send that person an invitation to the Network and add them to the Team by providing their email address in the search bar and selecting the option to send an invitation.

Once you've made all of your changes to the Team's membership, make sure to hit the "Save" button to finalize them.
