# Event Details

The event details screen contains all information about an event or event series.

Events in TIMU are either private events or Workspace events. Private events are created through the TIMU calendar app, are not associated with a specific Workspace, and anyone in your network can be added to a private event. Workspace events are created from with a Workspace’s Events module, and everyone in that Workspace has access to the event.

From the event details screen, you can view the event’s time, location, description, and attendees, as well as your attendance status. To change your attendance status for the event, click the “Change RSVP” button and select a new status. If you are an owner of the event, click the “Edit Event” button to make changes to the event.

If the event is an online meeting, you can click the “Join Meeting” button to launch the video call lobby screen. SEE: [Video Calls](Video%20Calls.html)

On the right-hand side of the event details, you’ll be able to see the event calendar, the time and date of the selected event occurrence, your attendance status, and the list of attendees. If you are an event owner, invitations can be re-sent to all attendees by clicking the “Resend Invites” button.

If you are viewing an event series, you will be able to see all occurrences within the series on the event calendar. Occurrences will be labeled with colored dots on the calendar. Click on a date to view the details of the occurrence taking place on that day.

You can switch to the event’s comments or the Workspace file library using the tabs labeled “Comments” and “Files” at the top of the event details screen.

## Chat

The event chat screen works in much the same way that chats and comments work throughout TIMU. The chat history is preserved, and you can scroll through it to review the conversation. You can react to individual messages by clicking the thumbs-up emoji icon, and selecting a reaction from the pop-up that appears. If you want to delete one of your own messages, click the triple-dot icon that appears when you hover over a message and select “Delete”.

To send a message, type your message in the reply box at the bottom of the feed and press Enter or click the “Send” button. As with all chat features in TIMU, you can attach files, share external links, and mention other users in the event with the @mention feature. Note that while @mentioning is supported in the event details, all users in the event will receive notifications for every message, regardless of whether they were mentioned in the message.

If any users are currently viewing this event, their profile pictures will appear to the left of the “Send” button.

## File Library

Whenever a user attaches a file to an event message, that file is automatically added to the Workspace’s file library. These files can be previewed, downloaded, and, in some cases, edited directly from the file library. Hovering over a file will cause the triple-dot icon to appear, and clicking on this icon allows you to rename, delete, or share the file.

Files in libraries support some bulk actions. To take a bulk action on a group of files (e.g., to delete more than one file at a time), click the checkbox to the left of the file name for each file you would like to select, then perform the action you want to take on the files as normal.

File libraries support organization into folders and sub-folders. To create a new folder, click the “New Folder” button and specify a name for the folder. You can navigate between folder levels using the folder breadcrumbs that appears whenever you are viewing a folder’s contents.

To add files directly to a file library, click the “Upload Files” button and select the files you want to attach from your computer. To create a brand new file (e.g., a new Microsoft Word document), click the “New File” button and select the type of file you would like to create. You will be asked to provide a name for the file. When the file is created, you will be immediately taken to the preview page for that file.

To view a file’s preview, or to edit files (for file types supporting online editing), click the file’s name. SEE: [File Preview](File%20Preview.html)
