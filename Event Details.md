# Event Details

The TIMU Event Details dialog provides access to all of the information associated with a particular event (or occurrence of a recurring event).

There are four event detail tabs in the dialog: Details, Comments, Attendees, and Agenda. When you open the dialog, you will see the Details tab selected. It gives you the most important information about the event, including who created it, when (and where, if a location was provided) the event occurs, and how to dial in to attend if you aren't joining the meeting directly from TIMU.

The Attendees tab is a list of everyone invited to the event, along with their attendance status. Attendess listed as "Accepted" have indicated that they will attend the event. Attendees listed as "Declined" have indicated that they will not attend the event. Attendees listed as "Tentative" have either not responded to the invitation, or have indicated that they might attend. All users invited to an event (other than the event's creator) are listed as "Tentative" by default.

Attendees can be removed from the event by clicking the "-" icon on the right side. If you want to add new attendees, you must click "Edit this Event" on the right-hand info pane.

The Comments tab works like all comment sections throughout TIMU. Here, you can chat with other attendees (including @mentioning them to send them notifications), attach files, and review the conversation history for the event. Comments are associated with the specific occurrence of the event you are viewing.

The Agenda tab allows you to set and view the agenda for this event. Use it to communicate the topics to be discussed or the work to be done with the rest of your team. You can review the agendas from previous occurrences of the event by clicking the dropdown arrow on the right side and selecting a different date. Agendas are visible to all attendees.

The right-hand info pane of the Event Details dialog lets you take action on the event. Your attendance status is highlighted on one of the Yes/No/Maybe buttons. Click a different button to update your attendance status. Clicking "Join Meeting" will launch the TIMU video conference for this meeting, and clicking "Audio Only" will launch the conference with you in audio-only mode (your microphone will be enabled, but your camera will not).

If you are the owner of the event, you will also have options to "Edit this Event" and "Cancel this Event". Clicking "Edit this Event" will display the Edit Event Details dialog, allowing you to change any of the properties of the event or occurrence. Clicking "Cancel this Event" will remove it from the calendar and send cancelation notices to the other attendees.
